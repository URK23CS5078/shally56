Aim:
The aim of this exercise is to learn and understand how to work with
collaborative repository management using git.
Working with collaborative repository management using Git involves
collaborating with other developers and effectively managing changes to a shared
codebase. Here are some key practices and concepts to consider:
Forking a Repository
- When you want to contribute to a project hosted on a remote repository, it's
common to start by forking the repository.
- Forking creates a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account or
another hosting platform, where you can freely make changes without affecting
the original repository.
- To fork a repository on GitHub, navigate to the repository's page and click the
"Fork" button.
Cloning a Forked Repository
- After forking a repository, you need to clone the forked repository to your local
machine to start making changes.
- Use the `git clone` command, as explained in a previous answer, to clone the
forked repository.
Adding an Upstream Remote
- The original repository that you forked is known as the "upstream" repository.
It represents the source of truth for the project.
- To synchronize your forked repository with the latest changes from the upstream
repository, you can add an "upstream" remote.
- Use the `git remote add` command to add the upstream remote URL. For
example:
git remote add upstream <upstream-url>
Keeping Your Forked Repository Up to Date
- To incorporate the latest changes from the upstream repository into your forked
repository, follow these steps:
- Fetch the latest changes from the upstream remote: `git fetch upstream`
- Checkout your local main branch: `git checkout main`
- Merge the changes from the upstream/main branch into your local main
branch: `git merge upstream/main`
- Push the updated main branch to your forked repository: `git push origin
main`
Creating Branches for Collaborative Work
- When working on a collaborative project, it's common to create branches for
new features, bug fixes, or other changes.
- Use the `git branch` command to create a new branch: `git branch <branchname>`
- Switch to the newly created branch using `git checkout`: `git checkout
<branch-name>`
- Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in one command: `git
checkout -b <branch-name>`
Pushing Changes and Creating Pull Requests
- Once you've made changes on a branch, you can push the branch to your forked
repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`.
- After pushing the branch, you can create a pull request on the upstream
repository to propose your changes for merging into the main codebase.
- On the upstream repository's page, find the "Pull requests" section and click the
"New pull request" button.
- Select the appropriate branches for the base (usually main) and compare (your
branch) branches.
- Provide a title and description for your pull request, then click "Create pull
request" to submit it.
Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests
- Collaborators or maintainers of the upstream repository can review and
comment on your pull request.
- They may request changes or provide feedback before merging the changes.
- Once the pull request is approved, it can be merged into the main branch of the
upstream repository.
Result:
Working with collaborative repository management using git is done and
executed successfully.

Aim The aim of this experiment is to create implementation of core review in git
Description
Git is a powerful tool for version control, but it’s also a crucial tool for collaborating with remote
teams. When working remotely, effective communication and collaboration arekey to ensure that
your team is working together towards a common goal.
Use a shared repository Using a shared repository is the foundation of effective collaboration
with Git. By hosting your repository on a remote server, you can give your team members access
to the latest version of your code, regardless of their location.
Create a new repository: git init
Clone a repository: git clone [respository URL]
Add a remote repository: git remote add [name] [repository URL]
Fetch changes from a remote repository: git fetchPull
changes from a remote repository: git pull Push
changes to a remote repository: git push Use
Branching and merging Branching and merging are powerful features of Git that allow you to
work on multiple versions of your code simultaneously, without interfering with each other’s
work. By using branching and merging effectively, your team can work on different features or
bug fixes in parallel, without causing conflicts.
Create a new branch: git branch [name]Switch
to a branch: git checkout [name]Merge a
branch: git merge [name] Resolve merge
conflicts: git mergetool Delete a branch: git

branch -d [name]
Use Pull requests Pull requests are a great way to review and merge changes from differentteam
members before they are merged into the main codebase. By using pull requests, you can ensure
that your code is reviewed and tested before it is merged into the main branch, which can help
prevent bugs and other issues.
Create a new pull request: git request-pull [branch] [repository URL]
Review and merge a pull request: git pull-request
Close a pull request: git request-pull -C [branch] [repository URL]
Use Issue Tracking Issue tracking is a great way to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and
other issues that need to be addressed in your code. By using an issue tracking system like
GitHub Issues, you can assign tasks to team members, track progress, and ensure that all issues
are addressed in a timely manner.
Create a new issue: git commit -m “[issue number] [commit message]”
Assign an issue to a team member: git assign [username]
Clone an issue: git clone [issue number] Reopen an
issue: git reopen [issue number] Communicate
Effectively Effective communication is key to collaboration, especially in a remote team setting.
Use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to stay in touch with your team members, and use video
calls or screen sharing to discuss code changes or work on problems together.
Start a video call: git video-call [username]
Share yourscreen: gitscreen-share
Send a message: git message [username] [message]
Use Git hooks Git hooks are scripts that Git runs automatically at certain points in the
Gitworkflow. You can use Git hooks to automate repetitive tasks, enforce coding standards, or
perform other tasks that are important to your team’s workflow.
Install a git hook: git init [hook name]
Write a git hook script: nano.git/hooks/[hook name]

Make the Git hook script executable: chmod +x .git/hooks/[hook name]
Use Gitsubmodules Git submodules are repositories that are embedded inside other repositories.
You can use Git submodules to manage dependencies, or to includeshared code in multiple
projects.
Add a Git submodule: git submodule add [repository URL]
Update a Gitsubmodule: gitsubmodule update
Remove a Gitsubmodule: gitsubmodule deinit [submodule path]
Use Git aliases Git aliases are shortcuts for commonly used Git commands. You can useGit
aliases to save time and improve your productivity when working with Git.
Set up a Git alias: git config –global alias.[alias name] ‘[Git command]’
Use a Git alias: git [alias name]
